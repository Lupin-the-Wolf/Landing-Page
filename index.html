            <p class="story">Yellow House Creative is named after my grandfather’s old yellow house. I lived in it and took care of it after his passing, and one of the first things I ever did in that house was to create a film dark room in the basement with a few friends of mine. That was my first step of many in creating visual content while collaborating with others. Along the way, I realized that one of my greatest strengths was working together with others to create something bigger than ourselves.</p>
